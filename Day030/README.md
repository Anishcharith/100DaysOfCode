# Market Facilitation Index

* Green : This means that the number of participants entering the market increases, therefore the volume increases and the fresh incoming players align their positions in the direction of candlestick growth.
* Fade :  It means that the market participants are indifferent and the price movement is small on small volumes. This usually happens at the end of a trend.
* Fake : It is highly likely that the market is being supported by broker speculation and not any significant client volume.
* Squat : In this particular situation bulls and bears are fighting between themselves to see who will dominate the next trend. These battles are noticeable by the large sell and buy volumes. However, the price does not change appreciably since the strengths are equal. One of the competing parties either the buyers or the sellers will ultimately triumph in the battle.
