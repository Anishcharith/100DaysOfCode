# Random Walk Index

* The Random Walk Index is a technical indicator that compares a security’s price movements to random movements in an effort to determine if it’s in a statistically significant trend.
* This indicator was designed to determine if the security's price is just a random walk or a result of statistically significant trend
* William Feller, a mathematician specializing in probability theory, proved that the bounds of randomness – or displacement distances – could be calculated by taking the square foot of the number of binary events (such as a coin toss). Any movement beyond these bounds suggests that the movement is not random in nature. The Random Walk Index applies these principles when measuring the uptrend and downtrend to determine if it’s random or not.
* Readings above 1.0 indicate that a security is trending higher or lower, while readings below 1.0 suggest that a security may be moving randomly.
