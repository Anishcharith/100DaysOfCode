* closer the prices move to the upper band, the more overbought the market, and the closer the prices move to the lower band, the more oversold the market.
* The Squeeze : When the bands come close together, constricting the moving average, it is called a squeeze. A squeeze signals a period of low volatility and is considered by traders to be a potential sign of future increased volatility and possible trading opportunities.
* Breakouts : Approximately 90% of price action occurs between the two bands. Any breakout above or below the bands is a major event.
