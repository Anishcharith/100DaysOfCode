# 100DaysOfCode

* I will update this [progress log](https://github.com/Anishcharith/100DaysOfCode/blob/master/LOG.md) as I go and tweet with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
* Inspired by [pybites/100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode).
* Not sure if I can find 100 technical indicators :p will try my best.
